# Dano-Airlines-Survey

## Introduction
This project is an analysis for Dano Airlines, a Uk-based airline headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The latest passenger survey results just came in and it looks like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. I analyzed the date to spot notable reasons for decline and to find key areas to focus on for getting back on track. The survey was done with the use of ratings from 1-5. 

## Power BI Concepts applied:

- Data Modeling Star Schema (Many:*)
- Applied filters
